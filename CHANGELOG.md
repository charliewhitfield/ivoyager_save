## [v0.2.3] - UNRELEASED

Under development using Godot 4.7.2.

### Added
* Automation: IVSave declares its save, load and status members for an automation client, such as the [Assistant](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_assistant) plugin, in `AUTOMATION_METHODS` and `AUTOMATION_PROPERTIES`, with gates in `is_automation_available()`.

### Fixed
* `IVSaveUtils.debug_print_persist_register()` with `procedural_only` printed only the properties-only objects, so a load's unfreed-procedural-objects report never named the culprits.

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-06-29

Released using Godot 4.6.

### Changed
* Completed doc comments in all files.

### Fixed
* Allow nulls in object-typed arrays.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-02-09

Released using Godot 4.6.

(Only copyright year update...)

## [v0.1] - 2025-12-13

Beta release!

Released using Godot 4.5.1.

Breaks older savegame files!

### Fixed
* Procedural nodes are moved to their correct sibling index on load.
* Works now if dialogs are already in tree (rather than procedurally added).
* Some GUI issues from Godot 4.5 update.


## [v0.0.3] - 2025-06-12

Released using Godot 4.4.1.

Breaks older savegame files!

### Added

* Add Timer functionality for time-based autosaves.
* Add debug functions to test for unfreed procedural objects (likely from RefCounteds with unlisted references).
* More and better doc comments.

## [v0.0.2] - 2025-03-20

## v0.0.1 - 2025-03-07

Released using Godot 4.3. **The next release will have changes for 4.4!**

Initial alpha release!

This plugin replaces [ivoyager_tree_saver](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_tree_saver). It has that plugin's functionality plus save/load GUI classes taken out of [ivoyager_core](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_core).
